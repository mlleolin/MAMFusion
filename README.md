# MAMFusion
This project is the official open-source implementation of the paper "MAMFusion: Infrared and Visible Image Fusion Based on Main and Auxiliary Cross-Attention and Target Mask".
The core source code is now available for review. The complete code repository and pre-trained models will be released upon final acceptance of the paper. We appreciate your patience and interest.
